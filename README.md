# DECSC131_FurtherAnalyses

Project prompt:
For your final project, essentially you would submit a Jupyter notebook that contains an application of clustering analysis / time-series forecasting / supervised machine learning using a real-world dataset. If you are doing an analytics related project (e.g. demand forecasting) for your capstone/thesis, you may use that as a submission for this class. The only main requirement is that you would use machine learning for your project, and it would essentially follow the same case study format that you guys have done previously. Likewise, your project must be different from the case studies that you have done previously.
